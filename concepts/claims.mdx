# Claims

Claims represent a user's request to use a parking spot during a specific availability window. The claim system ensures fair and organized parking spot sharing within the community.

## Claim Lifecycle

### 1. **Pending** 
- Initial state when a user creates a claim
- Waiting for spot owner to confirm or reject
- The availability remains active for other potential claims

### 2. **Confirmed**
- Spot owner has approved the claim
- The availability becomes inactive (no longer available for new claims)
- The claimer can now use the parking spot during the specified time window
- **Claimers can release confirmed claims early** if they finish using the spot

### 3. **Released** ⭐ *New*
- Claimer has released the spot early (before the availability window ends)
- The availability becomes active again for others to claim
- Only confirmed claims can be released
- Only the claimer can release their own claims

### 4. **Expired**
- The availability window has passed
- Claim automatically expires if not used
- No longer actionable

### 5. **Cancelled**
- Claim was cancelled by either the claimer or spot owner
- The availability becomes active again if it was previously confirmed

## Claim Permissions

### Claimers
- Can create claims for available spots
- Can update their own claims (notes, etc.)
- Can release their own confirmed claims early
- Can delete their own claims
- Cannot release claims that are not confirmed
- Cannot release claims if the availability window has expired

### Spot Owners
- Can confirm or reject pending claims for their spots
- Can update claims for their spots (status changes)
- Can delete claims for their spots
- Cannot release claims (only claimers can release their own claims)

## Early Release Feature

The **Release Claim** feature allows claimers to return spots early, making them available again for others. This improves parking spot utilization and community efficiency.

### When to Release
- You finish using the spot before the availability window ends
- You no longer need the spot
- You want to help others who might need parking

### Release Rules
- ✅ Only confirmed claims can be released
- ✅ Only the claimer can release their own claims
- ✅ Availability window must still be active
- ❌ Cannot release pending, expired, or cancelled claims
- ❌ Cannot release claims after the availability window has expired

### What Happens When Released
1. Claim status changes from `confirmed` to `released`
2. Availability becomes active again (if no other confirmed claims exist)
3. Other users can now claim the spot
4. Original availability window end time is still respected

## API Endpoints

- `GET /claims` - List claims with optional filtering
- `POST /claims` - Create a new claim
- `PUT /claims` - Update an existing claim
- `PATCH /claims` - Release a confirmed claim ⭐ *New*
- `DELETE /claims` - Delete a claim

## Example Workflow

1. **User A** creates a claim for Spot 12 (2:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
2. **Owner** confirms the claim
3. **User A** uses the spot from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM
4. **User A** releases the claim early
5. **User B** can now claim Spot 12 for the remaining time (4:00 PM - 6:00 PM)

This system ensures maximum parking spot utilization while maintaining fair access for all community members.
