# Parking Spots

Parking spots are the core entities in the Harbor Parking system. Each spot represents a physical parking location within a building that can be shared by residents.

## Structure

A parking spot contains the following information:

- **Spot Number**: Unique identifier for the spot (e.g., "A-15", "B-23")
- **Location**: Description of where the spot is located (e.g., "Level 2 Parking Garage", "Near Elevator 3")
- **Owner**: The resident who registered the spot
- **Verification Status**: Whether the spot has been approved by building management
- **Active Status**: Whether the spot is currently available for sharing

## Registration Process

1. **Resident Registration**: A resident registers their parking spot with basic information
2. **Admin Verification**: Building management verifies the spot details
3. **Activation**: Once verified, the spot becomes available for sharing

## Ownership

- Each spot has one owner (the resident who registered it)
- Only the owner can create availability windows for their spot
- Owners can update spot details or remove the spot entirely

## Sharing Model

- **Owner Control**: Spot owners decide when their spot is available
- **Time Windows**: Owners set specific time periods when their spot can be claimed
- **First-Come-First-Served**: Available spots can be claimed by any resident on a first-come-first-served basis
