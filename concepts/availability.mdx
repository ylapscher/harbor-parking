# Availability

Availability windows define when a parking spot can be claimed by other residents. Each availability represents a time period during which the spot owner has made their parking spot available for sharing.

## Structure

An availability contains the following information:

- **Spot ID**: Reference to the parking spot being made available
- **Start Time**: When the availability window begins
- **End Time**: When the availability window ends
- **Notes**: Optional notes from the spot owner
- **Active Status**: Whether the availability is currently active
- **Owner**: The resident who created the availability

## Time Windows

- **Future-Only**: Availability windows must start in the future
- **Duration**: Windows can range from hours to days
- **Flexibility**: Owners can create multiple overlapping windows
- **Immediate**: Spots can be made immediately available

## Status Management

- **Active**: The spot is available for claiming
- **Inactive**: The spot is not available (claimed or manually deactivated)
- **Expired**: The time window has passed

## Claiming Process

1. **Owner Creates Availability**: Spot owner sets a time window when their spot is available
2. **Residents Browse**: Other residents can see available spots
3. **First-Come-First-Served**: First person to claim gets the spot
4. **Automatic Deactivation**: Once claimed, the availability becomes inactive
