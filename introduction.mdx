## Welcome to Harbor Parking

Harbor Parking is a modern resident parking spot sharing platform that transforms chaotic WhatsApp group coordination into a streamlined web application. Our API enables developers to build applications that help residents efficiently share unused parking spots, set availability windows, and coordinate guest parking.

## What Harbor Parking Solves

In residential buildings, parking coordination is often chaotic:
- **Informal coordination** via WhatsApp groups leads to missed messages
- **No transparency** about who owns which spots
- **Conflicts arise** when multiple people want the same spot
- **No audit trail** of parking arrangements
- **Time-consuming** manual coordination processes

Harbor Parking provides a structured, transparent solution that:
- ✅ **Streamlines communication** with real-time availability updates
- ✅ **Prevents conflicts** through organized claim management  
- ✅ **Increases utilization** by making unused spots easily discoverable
- ✅ **Provides accountability** with clear ownership and reservation records
- ✅ **Saves time** through automated coordination workflows
