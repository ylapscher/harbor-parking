## **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**  
**Project Name:** Resident Parking Spot Sharing Platform  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Prepared By:** Yoel Lapscher
**Date:** August 1, 2025

## **1. Executive Summary**  
The Resident Parking Spot Sharing Platform addresses the coordination challenges in residential buildings where parking is limited. Currently managed through informal WhatsApp groups, this system will provide a professional web application for residents to share unused parking spots, set availability windows, and coordinate guest parking efficiently. The platform includes admin oversight for user verification and comprehensive API documentation for potential future integrations.
