# Authentication Timeout Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to handle authentication timeouts and ensure a better user experience when Supabase services are slow or unreachable.

## Changes Made

### 1. Reduced Timeout Values
- **Session fetch timeout**: Reduced from 10 seconds to 3 seconds
- **Profile fetch timeout**: Reduced from 5 seconds to 2 seconds
- **Loading state fallback**: Set to 5 seconds (ensures UI never gets stuck)

### 2. Improved Supabase Client Configuration
Added custom configuration to the Supabase client in `lib/supabase/singleton.ts`:
- Custom fetch implementation with 5-second global timeout
- Persistent session storage with key `harbor-auth`
- Optimized realtime connection settings

### 3. Development Mode Bypass
Enhanced the development experience with immediate mock data when:
- Running in development mode (`NODE_ENV === 'development'`)
- User has recently logged in (tracked via localStorage)
- Provides instant loading without waiting for Supabase

### 4. Fallback Mechanisms
- localStorage tracking of successful logins (`harbor-login-success`)
- 5-minute grace period after login where users can access the app even if Supabase is unreachable
- Graceful degradation when profile data is unavailable

## Testing

### Automated Validation
Run the test script to validate timeout configuration:
```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env.local | xargs) && node test-auth-timeout.js
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Test Normal Sign-In Flow**
   - Clear browser cache and localStorage
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Sign in with valid credentials
   - Verify dashboard loads within 5 seconds

2. **Test Slow Network Conditions**
   - Use browser DevTools to throttle network to "Slow 3G"
   - Attempt to sign in
   - Verify appropriate timeout messages appear in console
   - Confirm the app remains responsive

3. **Test Development Bypass**
   - Sign in successfully once
   - Stop the Supabase service (or disconnect internet)
   - Refresh the page
   - Verify the app loads with mock data in development mode

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization
- Session fetch: Up to 10 seconds timeout
- Total auth initialization: Up to 15+ seconds
- Users stuck on loading screen during timeouts

### After Optimization
- Session fetch: 3 seconds max
- Profile fetch: 2 seconds max
- Total auth initialization: 5 seconds max (with fallback)
- Graceful degradation with mock data in development

## Error Handling
The system now handles these scenarios gracefully:
- Supabase service unavailable
- Network timeouts
- Missing environment variables
- Profile table access issues
- Slow database queries

## Monitoring
Watch for these console messages during development:
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Session fetch timed out, continuing without session` - Indicates Supabase connection issues
- `Auth loading timeout, forcing non-loading state` - Fallback triggered
- `üöÄ Dev bypass active - using mock user` - Development mode bypass active

## Future Improvements
Consider implementing:
1. Retry logic with exponential backoff
2. Circuit breaker pattern for Supabase calls
3. Better offline support with service workers
4. Caching strategy for user profiles
